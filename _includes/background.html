      As a Software Quality Advocate, I like to think out of the box when Iâ€™m testing and focus on our customers experience and expectations. I look beyond the available requirements. I want to think about how customers would use our products and what the competition is doing to add valuable feedback to our product team.
       &mdash; I think my experience will help other testers and developers evolve and build a great team and culture.
      I also strive to have a great work ethic where honest feedback is a necessity and go the extra mile to achieve successful project deliveries.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably listening to music, playing the keyboard,
      or playing football.
